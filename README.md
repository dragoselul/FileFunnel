## Motivation

### <b>Status</b>: Early development‚Äîcurrently in MVP stage.

I was drowning in a sea of duplicates and a messy file system on my external hard drive‚Äîforgetting I already had copies of files, scattering work across random folders. FileFunnel solves this by watching a central "dump" folder, detecting duplicates, and sorting everything into a user-defined folder structure. Now you can find what you need, when you need it, without clutter and confusion.

---

## Features

- **Funnel Folder Watcher**: Automatically monitors a designated folder for new files and sorts them according to the rules set by the user.
- **Custom Rules-Based Sorting**: Define folder structures and matchers (extensions, regex) to route files where you want.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and handle duplicate files to free up storage space.
- **Filesystem Organizer**: Moves and renames files to keep your drives neat and accessible.
- **CLI & GUI**: Full-featured command-line interface for scripting and a sleek Avalonia-based desktop UI.
- **Future üéØ**: Git-like versioning for documents (coming soon).

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: C#/.NET
- **UI Framework**: Avalonia (cross-platform desktop on Windows & Linux)
- **Watcher & Sorting Engine**: `.NET FileSystemWatcher` + regex/metadata-based rules

---
